# nanoc-OO

the main idea is to decouple Rules file to classes

also by default files extensions *are* used to apply filters to layouts and items

TODO:
 * refactor temp spec helpers
 * refactor specs with true/false variant arrays
 * check coverage
 * use `context` properly (in specs)
 * specs want to be cleaned
 * refactor specs...
 * fix specs: `it 'should work'`, `it 'routes properly'`, ...
 * extract `"#{ SITE }/output/#{ name }..."`
 
**?** `#binary?` through ptools or nanoc config
